/*!
 UMKPatternMatchingMockRequest are mock requests that match URL requests based on a URL pattern. Each pattern-matching
 mock request has an associated URL pattern and a responder generation block. The URL pattern is a SOCKit pattern, e.g.,
 http://hostname.com/:directory/:subdirectory/:resource. When a URL request matches the receiver’s URL pattern, the
 receiver calls its responder generation block with the request and the URL pattern parameters parsed from the request’s
 URL. You can use this block to generate an appropriate responder based on the contents of the URL request.

 In addition to the URL pattern, you can optionally provide a set of HTTP methods and a request-matching block to
 perform further tests on a request before matching it. See the documentation below for more details.
 
 Note that due to the fact that a single pattern-matching mock request can match many actual requests, pattern-matching
 mock requests are not removed from UMKMockURLProtocol’s set of expected mock requests after they service a request. To
 remove a pattern-matching mock request, you can either remove the request manually using +[UMKMockURLProtocol
 removeExpectedMockRequest:] or reset UMKMockURLProtocol entirely using +[UMKMockURLProtocol reset].

 @abstract The instance's URL pattern.
 @discussion This pattern should be a valid SOCKit pattern. See the SOCKit documentation for more information.

     Note that only the part of the URL up to the query string is used to match the pattern. This simplifies issues
     related to query parameter ordering. If you need to examine the query parameters to determine whether to match a
     request, you can do so using a request-matching block.

 @abstract The instance’s request-matching block.
 @discussion By default, the instance will only determine whether a request matches using its URL pattern and HTTP
     methods. If you provide a request-matching block, it will be called afterwards so that you can perform
     additional tests on the URL request being matched. The return value of the block will determine if the instance
     matches the request or not.
 
     If a request has a non-nil HTTPBodyStream, your request matching block should not attempt to read it under any
     circumstances, even by using -umk_HTTPBodyData. Doing so will make the body unreadable on subsequent attempts,
     most notably by other potential mock requests or in the body of your responder generation block. This is due to
     the nature of data streams. If the request has a non-nil HTTPBody, you may freely read the body in your block.
