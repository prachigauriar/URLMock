/*!
 UMKIntegrationTestCase is the base class for URLMock integration tests. It enables UMKMockURLProtocol on
 +setUp, resets it on -setUp, and disables it on +tearDown.
 
 Additionally, it provides a connection queue for connection operations and can start a connection for a 
 URL request on that queue and return a verifier for that connection.
