/*!
 UMKURLConnectionVerifier objects help validate that NSURLConnections are receiving the correct responses. They
 are designed to be used as a connection's delegate. They save the connection's response, error, and body, and can
 indicate if a connection is complete, i.e., it has finished loading or failed with an error.
 
 When used with a UMKMessageCountingProxy, connection verifiers can be used to ensure that a connection delegate
 received the correct delegate messages.
 
 If the verifier's connection uses a delegate operation queue, or delegate methods are being invoked on their own
 thread, you can use -waitForCompletion or -waitForCompletionWithTimeout: to efficiently wait until the connection
 is complete. This is very useful when using connection verifiers in unit testing.
 
 Note that connection verifiers are only meant to be used once per connection. Create a new instance if you need 
 to verify another connection.
