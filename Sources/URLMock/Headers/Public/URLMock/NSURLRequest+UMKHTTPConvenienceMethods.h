 The UMKHTTPConvenienceMethods category on NSURLRequest adds methods to NSURLRequests to make it easier to
 get the request’s HTTP body in numerous forms and compare its HTTP headers to those in a specified dictionary.

@interface NSURLRequest (UMKHTTPConvenienceMethods)

/*!
 @abstract Returns the receiver’s HTTP body as an NSData instance.
 @discussion This method works by first checking if the receiver has an HTTP body stream. If so,
     the stream’s data is collected in an NSData instance and returned. Otherwise, this method
     just returns the same thing as -HTTPBody.
 
     Note that if the receiver has an HTTP body stream, this method may only be invoked once per URL request.
     Subsequent invocations will return nil.

 @abstract Returns the receiver's HTTP body as a JSON object.
 @discussion This method is implemented using -umk_HTTPBodyData. As such, if the receiver has an HTTP body stream, 
     this method may only be invoked once per URL request. Subsequent invocations will return nil.
 @result The receiver's body as a JSON object, or nil if the receiver's body does not contain valid JSON data.

 @discussion This method is implemented using -umk_HTTPBodyData. As such, if the receiver has an HTTP body stream,
     this method may only be invoked once per URL request. Subsequent invocations will return nil.
 @result A dictionary of the receiver's body as form parameters. Keys are strings. Values are either strings or the
