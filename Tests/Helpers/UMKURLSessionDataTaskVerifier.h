/*!
 UMKURLSessionDataTaskVerifier objects help validate that NSURLSession data tasks are receiving the correct 
 responses. They are designed to be used as a session data task’s delegate. They save the task’s response, 
 error, and body, and can indicate if a task is complete, i.e., it has finished loading or failed with an error.

 When used with a UMKMessageCountingProxy, data task verifiers can be used to ensure that a data task delegate
 received the correct delegate messages.

 If the verifier's session uses a delegate operation queue, or delegate methods are being invoked on their own
 thread, you can use -waitForCompletion or -waitForCompletionWithTimeout: to efficiently wait until the data task
 is complete. This is very useful when using data task verifiers in unit testing.

 Note that data task verifiers are only meant to be used once per data task. Create a new instance if you need
 to verify another data task.
