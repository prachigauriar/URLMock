/*!
 UMKMockHTTPResponder objects respond to mock HTTP URL requests. Instances can be created to respond with
 an NSError, an HTTP response, or even an HTTP response with its body broken into multiple chunks that are
 delivered over time.
 
 To simplify its interface, UMKMockHTTPResponder is implemented as a class cluster. Subclasses effectively 
 have to reimplement everything from scratch, and the only important common interface is already defined in
 UMKMockURLResponder. As such, there is little reason to ever subclass this class.

 @abstract Returns a new UMKMockHTTPResponder instance that responds by sending the specified error.
 @discussion The specified error is the one that is _sent_ to the NSURL system in response to a mock
     URL request; however, the NSURL system may modify it by adding fields to the error's userInfo or
     even changing the error's code. As such, expectations about the actual error that will be received
     should be limited. At best, individual fields in the error should be examined to ensure they match
     expectations.
 @param error The error to respond with. May not be nil.
