 Instances of UMKMessageCountingProxy count how many times their associated objects have received messages.
 This is useful when testing that APIs are actually being invoked.
 
 Message counting proxies only count messages when the message is sent through the proxy. If the message is
 sent directly to the proxy's object, the proxy can't count that message.
